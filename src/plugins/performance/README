PERFORMANCE Plugin

This project aims at providing simple instrumentation to provide realtime statistics about your program "from the inside".

Analyzers:
    * events queue size
    * template containers size (check for ever-growing containers (unallocated stuff))
    * signals-slots chains (a tree-like graph that shows loops)
    * thread usage timeline
    * events duration/statistics
    * tresholds on over-long events, with full traces
    * mean size of filled areas
    * auto-alarms with full problem reporting

GUI:
    * viewer on the bottom bar
    * alarms on the left bar

In the first stage it will collect timing informations about functions invocation from the event loop and periodically elaborate and print statistics about:

    * top time-consuming functions
    * function invocation frequency
    * histogram of timing for a given function
    * frequency analysis for a function (FFT)

In the next stages statistics are likely to be send over the network to a local or remote computer and watched real-time, for profiling in an easy and understandable way.

To Add:
    * use backtraces to merge stuff and have longer history
