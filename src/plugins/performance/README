PERFORMANCE Plugin

This project aims at providing simple instrumentation to provide realtime statistics about your program "from the inside".

In the first stage it will collect timing informations about functions invocation from the event loop and periodically elaborate and print statistics about:

    * top time-consuming functions
    * function invocation frequency
    * histogram of timing for a given function
    * frequency analysis for a function 

In the next stages statistics are likely to be send over the network to a local or remote computer and watched real-time, for profiling in an easy and understandable way.
